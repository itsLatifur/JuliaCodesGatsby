              I had the opportunity to work at{" "}
              <a href="https://awkward.co">Awkward</a>, a digital product agency
              in The Netherlands for my 2019 Summer Internship. This was an
              amazing experience where I was able to work alongside senior
              Developers and experienced Designers to build multiple powerful
              client facing products. <br /> <br />
              Throughout the summer I was pushed and challenged in every aspect
              of my skills and walked away as a much more refined developer.

            <Paragraph>
              Prior to arriving at Awkward, I set some personal goals for myself
              so that I had clear objectives on what I wanted to improve on and
              accomplish. Of these goals, my main priority involved improving my
              abilities with React.

              <Paragraph>
                For this project I used React, but many different Javascript
                libraries could've been used, and even vanilla Javascript could
                have been easily implemented. I chose to use React because of
                its ease of use and the ability to smoothly manipulate states
                without having to re-render the pages.

              <Paragraph>
                GraphQL was mainly chosen because I wanted to improve my
                abilities with it, but also because their server performance is
                extremely fast, and I knew there wouldn't be any wait time. To
                publish the application, I hosted it through Netlify, because
                its easy, free and how I've hosted many of my projects.

              project. I'd really like to update the background images so that
              they display based on what the weather status currently is, so
              that the application has the feel of the weather they're currently
              experiencing. I also have plans to create secondary zip-codes, so
              the user can click back and forth between two locations and
              compare the weather.
