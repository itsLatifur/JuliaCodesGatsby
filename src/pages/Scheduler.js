          Atmosphere TV delivers streaming content to thousands of venues across
          the country—but despite a robust content library, many business owners
          were seeing the same few clips on repeat. This case study details how
          I led a UX initiative to uncover the root of this content fatigue, and
          designed a scalable scheduling solution that increased content
          discovery, improved engagement, and balanced the needs of both small
          businesses and enterprise users.
          <br /> <br /> Through user interviews, prototyping, and real-world
          testing, we reimagined how content is selected, scheduled, and
          controlled—transforming the way businesses use Atmosphere to entertain
          their customers.
          <br /> <br /> Note: Some details have been modified or generalized to
          respect company confidentiality.

          This comment from a restaurant owner during a customer interview
          captured the core challenge facing Atmosphere TV. Business owners were
          growing frustrated with the limited content variety on their screens,
          and engagement was suffering. Driving owners to turn off Atmosphere TV
          in favor of other content providers.

          With these questions in mind, I created a low fidelity prototype to
          test with users and begin uncovering what would be most helpful.
          <br />
          <br />
          The prototype introduced a popup onboarding flow with two paths: one
          allowed users to build their own schedule by entering content goals
          and selecting preferred content types—Atmosphere would then generate a
          tailored schedule. The other offered pre-curated schedules based on
          the user's venue type.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each of the steps in this flow were designed to help us uncover the
          answers to our key questions, and seeing which path users took helped
          us to understand how custom the scheduling solution would need to be.

          Above all, it was clear that an automated solution was not clicking

            <ul>
              <li>
                This would allow us to provide a dynamic content experience for
                venues who didn't need or want to invest time in customization

          After several rounds of iterations and sketches, I decided to move
          schedule creation into a full-page experience rather than a popup or
          multi-step flow. I wanted users to have the flexibility to choose
          their starting point. The designs below allow users to create
          schedules with custom names, venue selection, and channel choices. I
          also included a thumbnail to visually represent the content within
          each schedule as users add them.

          To solve the problem of tedious schedule creation, I thought up the
          idea of a 'default channel', essentially a channel that filled the
          gaps and worked as a fallback between the other scheduled events.
          <br /> <br />
          This helped users fill the entire schedule without needing to drag in
          the same channel multiple times, and made it much clearer what would
          be playing at any given time in the schedule.
